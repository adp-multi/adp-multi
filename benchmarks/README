NOTE: The main benchmark (Benchmarks.hs) can only be compiled with GHC 7.6 (see ADPfusion requirements)

Also, the criterion branch from coreyoconnor is used as it uses CPU time instead of wall time.
(https://github.com/coreyoconnor/criterion)

run
> adp-multi-benchmarks -o report.html -u report.csv
to get a visual benchmark report and csv file

For the GAPC benchmarks the nussinov.gap file was used as input and the generated
C++ code was then slightly modified to allow for benchmarking. See gapc_main.cc.
Note that the GAP grammar for Nussinov looks slightly different than the Haskell-ADP and
adp-multi grammars. This is because GAPC only allows some fixed terminal parsers, in this
case CHAR, instead of char 'a' etc. Due to this, the filtering mechanism has to be used
to parse matching base pairs. The same applies to the Nussinov grammar for
ADPfusion, see http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Nussinov78.
